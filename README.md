# The master product roadmap for Navgurukul
The big efforts required to meet NG's overall objectives and the timeline for implementing features and requirements that align with our strategy.

## What is a product roadmap?
A product roadmap is a shared source of truth that outlines the vision, direction, priorities, and progress of a product over time. It’s a plan of action that aligns the organization around short- and long-term goals for the product or project, and how they will be achieved.

While it's common for the roadmap to show what you’re building, it’s just as important to show why. Items on the roadmap should be clearly linked to your product strategy, and your roadmap should be responsive to changes in customer feedback and the competitive landscape.

Product managers use roadmaps to collaborate with their teams and build consensus on how a product will grow and shift over time. Agile teams turn to the roadmap to keep everyone on the same page and gain context for their everyday work and future direction.

## Who is this roadmap for?
This roadmap is intended for the following audiences in specific ways as outlined below:

1. Development team: may use this roadmap to glean details about the prioritised customer value to be delivered, target release dates and milestones. The roadmap is organized by sprints and show specific pieces of work and problem areas plotted on a timeline.
2. Internal roadmap for executives: may use this roadmap to emphasize how teams' work supports high-level company goals and metrics.
3. External roadmap for partners: this roadmap also serves as a mechanism to inform channel partners about what’s coming next. They typically provide a high-level, generalized view of new features and prioritized problem areas to get partners interested in the future direction of the product.
